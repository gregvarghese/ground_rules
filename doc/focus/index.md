# For focus

Focus is limited so budget it wisely.

Decide on team indicators that mean "do not disturb" then respect them.

Designate times and places for louder/bigger work and quieter/smaller work.

Focus can be improved via mindfulness meditation and breathing exercises.

Focus can be improved via occasional breaks.

Try the Pomodoro technique: First set a timer for 25 minutes of focused work. Then set a timer for 5 minutes of break. After four rounds, take a longer break of 30 minutes.
