# Ways of Working

Ways of Working (WoW) is a phrase that summarizes how people collaborate, typically focusing on teamwork success. Ways of Working may be also known as working agreements, team arrangements, shared expectations, group understandings, and ground rules.

## What are Ways of Working?

Ways of Working are guidelines that improve teamwork and communication. Ways of Working can define a team's set of expectations for participating, collaborating, and interrelating.

Ways of Working can include ground rules, aspirations, team values, team norms,
working agreements, and more. For a deep dive on these see [Esther
Derby](doc/team-norms-by-esther-derby/index.md).

* <b>Ground rules</b> are statements of how people need to behave, for specific
  times, places, and situations. Example: At our meetings, everyone has the
  opportunity to speak.

* <b>Aspirations</b> are statements intended to guide interactions and decision
  making within the group, and also across other groups within the organization.
  Example: Every challenge is an opportunity to learn.

* <b>Team values</b> are statements of what people hold as important. Often,
  teams make a list of their values by using behavior-related nouns. Example: We
  value courage, collaboration, respect.

* <b>Team norms</b> are informal implicit standards of behavior that emerge over
  time from the interactions of the group. Example: By observing the team, we
  see that teammates are punctual.

* <b>Working agreements</b> are protocols that the group develops together,
  commits to follow together, and agreed to uphold together. Example: Code is
  complete when all tests pass.


## Ideas


### For goodness, wellness, positivity, etc.

Be creative. Be constructive. Be collaborative.

Be prepared. Be present. Be productive.

[More…](doc/goodness/index.md)


### For collaborators, friends, partners, etc.

View the issue as “we” not “me”.

Consider what's happening from each person's perspective.

[More…](doc/collaborators/index.md)


### For respect

Presume good-faith intentions.

Debate the issue, not the person.

[More…](doc/respect/index.md)


### For discussions, forums, chats, etc.

Encourage everyone to participate fully.

Listen actively and attentively.

[More…](doc/discussions/index.md)


### For feedback, advice, coaching, etc.

Ask for feedback often.

Ensure you’re giving lots of positive feedback.

[More…](doc/feedback/index.md)


### For meetings, briefings, standups, etc.

Prepare the participants. For example "The purpose of this meeting is X because Y".

Plan the outcome. For example "At the end of this meeting we want X because Y".

[More…](doc/meetings/index.md)


### For schedules, calendars, events, etc.

Use the strengths of "maker's schedule, manager's schedule".

Ensure all stakeholders know the expectations for availability, attendance, and RSVPs.

[More…](doc/schedules/index.md)


### For signing, video calls, loud rooms, etc.

Voting: thumb up means yes, down means no, sideways means maybe. Everyone votes and the leader tallies.

Clarification: make the letter "C" hand sign. Everyone pauses and the leader figures out what's needed.

[More…](doc/signing/index.md)


### For bonding, all-hands, kick-offs, etc.

Team bonding is good and valuable because it improves communication.

Try multiple kinds of bonding events, such as all-hands, kick-offs, offsites, outings, fun events, etc.

[More…](doc/bonding/index.md)


### For orientation, onboarding, offboarding, etc.

We use a "people" document. It lists our names, contact information, roles, responsibilities, etc.

We use a "pitch" document. It summarizes the project and its progress, much like a startup pitch deck.

[More…](doc/orientation/index.md)


### For credentials, passwords, badges, etc.

Each teammate gets their own credentials, such as a username, a password, a security badge, etc.

Each teammate knows how to get new credentials, manage them securely, and revoke them if necessary.

[More…](doc/credentials/index.md)


### For shared spaces, group areas, public rooms, etc.

Post relevant information prominently, such as the shared space's phone numbers, wifi codes, room reservations, etc.

Whiteboards are eraseable any time; please erase any whiteboard writing that says "Do not erase".

[More…](doc/shared-spaces/index.md)


### For mutual interactions

Have mutual respect.

Have mutual purpose.

[More…](doc/mutual/index.md)


### For focus

Focus is limited so budget it wisely.

Decide on team indicators that mean "do not disturb" then respect them.

[More…](doc/focus/index.md)


### For team success

<!-- N.b. these come from Google -->

Dependability: we get things done on time and meet expectations.

Clarity: we have clear goals and well-defined roles.

Meaning: our work has personal significance to each member.

Impact: our work is purposeful and positively impacts the greater good.

Psychological safety: everyone is safe to take risks, voice opinions, and ask questions.



### For communications

Communications are radiated when events happen, so teammates can be in the loop.

Communications have preferred channels, such as chat, or email, or video, or forum.

Communications provide equitable participation for everyone involved.


### For email

If you're sending a message that is urgent, then write "URGENT" in the subject line.

If you're sending a message that is informative and doesn't need action, then use "CC" field, not the "To" field.

If you're sending a message that needs action, then be clear and direct about what's needed.


### For personal safety nets

Each teammate has a crossover person that is able to handle the teammate's work in their absence.

Each teammate knows what to do if their other teamates need to be unexpectedly absent.

Each teammate tests their own backups to ensure they're always usable.

<!-- 

TODO

Teammates commit to read communications sent directly to them within 1 business day.

If you have a social network page that's relevant to the team, such as LinkedIn page, then make sure it's current.

Use every failure as an opportunity to learn.
